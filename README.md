Oregon State University ENGR 103 Final Project

Description:

This is the Yelling Game where the goal is to test your yelling abilities. There are two modes: singleplayer and multiplayer. In singleplayer mode you test your ability to yell at the right levels to progress through each stage. In multiplayer you go head to head with another player and see who yells the loudest!
