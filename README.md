# The Yelling Game
Will Morton's Oregon State University ENGR 103 Final Project

## Description

This is the Yelling Game where the goal is to test your yelling abilities. There are two modes: singleplayer and multiplayer. In singleplayer mode you test your ability to yell at the right levels to progress through each stage. In multiplayer you go head to head with another player and see who yells the loudest!

This game requires an Adafruit Playground Express, a micro-sub cable, and a working computer that can run the Arduino IDE. 

1. Make sure you have downloaded the Arduino IDE from https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360019833020-Download-and-install-Arduino-IDE. 
2. Download the yellGame.ino file and open it inside of the Arduino IDE. 
3. Connect your Adafruit Circuit Playground Express to your computer via the micro-usb cable.
4. Within the Arduino IDE, install the Adafruit Circuit Playground library using the "Library Manager" icon on the left side of the IDE (It looks like books.)
5. Make sure that the Circuit Playground board is selected by checking near the top of the screen.
