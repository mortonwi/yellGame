# Yelling Game
Oregon State University ENGR 103 Final Project

# Description

This is the Yelling Game where the goal is to test your yelling abilities. There are two modes: singleplayer and multiplayer. In singleplayer mode you test your ability to yell at the right levels to progress through each stage. In multiplayer you go head to head with another player and see who yells the loudest!

# Installation

This game requires an Adafruit Playground Express board, a micro-sub cable, and a working computer that can run the Arduino IDE. Simply download the yellGame.ino file and upload it to your board via a COMM channel in the Arduino IDE.
